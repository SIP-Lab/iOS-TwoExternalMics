> **Abstract:** This paper presents an approach to overcome the limitation imposed by existing smartphone operating systems in using two microphones of smartphones at the same time for real-time low-latency audio apps that require the use of two microphones. This approach involves the use of an external dual-microphone and the processing steps needed to access audio signals from both of the external microphones at the same time. The developed approach is then applied to two example audio applications consisting of noise classification and noise reduction. It is shown that these dual-microphone apps lead to improved noise classification and noise reduction accuracy compared to the apps using a single microphone.
